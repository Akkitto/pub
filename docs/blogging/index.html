Tried it multiple times throughout many years and here we go again...</p><span id=continue-reading></span><h2 id=why-blog><a aria-label="Anchor link for: why-blog" class=zola-anchor href=#why-blog>Why blog?</a></h2><p>When you're that kind of person, that constantly is stimulated by everything around you, then your day is pretty much a constant flow of ideas and new things to do and accomplish. It is difficult to pick only one thing and pursue it. It is even more difficult to keep track of the other ideas, you didn't pick, even though they might perhaps help or at least inspire somebody else. If I can improve anyone's life with any of my thoughts, then I'm glad to share them.<h2 id=history><a aria-label="Anchor link for: history" class=zola-anchor href=#history>History</a></h2><p>Over decades, I had all these ideas and so great things to say (since every human on earth thinks of oneself to have the best ideas ever), yet in 99% of cases I did not document & not to mention follow up on them, at all.<p>Growing up with this constant loss of life-advancing energy, I realised, I had to finally put a stop to this and actually start documenting my life, experiences and, most importantly, knowledge.<h3 id=second-brain><a aria-label="Anchor link for: second-brain" class=zola-anchor href=#second-brain>Second Brain</a></h3><p>So, a couple of years ago, I finally started creating and using my newly founded <a href=https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/>second brain</a>.<p>The method of saving & ordering information I use is <a href=https://www.lucapallotta.com/para/>P.A.R.A.</a> and so far it did not let me down.<h3 id=public-blogging><a aria-label="Anchor link for: public-blogging" class=zola-anchor href=#public-blogging>Public Blogging</a></h3><p>Over the years, I tried many methods of publishing my ideas, but I never was satisfied with the common tools in use. For example, I obviously had tried <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, as did everybody else at some point in life, similar alternatives & even loads of crap like <a href=https://wordpress.org/>Wordpress</a>.<p>Never was satisfied with the results, because in one way, they were way too advanced and <em>fancy</em>, but in other ways, they were way too basic, by not supporting features that I personally find important for my blogging experience, like e.g. <a href=https://asciidoc.org/>AsciiDoc</a>, rather than only <a href=https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>Markdown</a> or displaying raw article content, aside from rendered <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>JavaScript</a> & <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/>HTML</a>.<p>So, every single time I lost interest in keeping up to date with each blog, as it became a pain the more and more I used those platforms or tools.<p>Now, I regret all this a bit, as I would've liked to not only document most of the stuff happening in my brain, but also share it with everybody, even if it only results in inspiring a single person on earth to improve personal life - akin to "If you want to change the world, change yourself.", i.e. making that person improve the world, bit by bit. Every step counts.<h2 id=the-future-is-now-old-man><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-future-is-now-old-man" class=zola-anchor href=#the-future-is-now-old-man>The Future is now, old man</a></h2><p>What did I learn, what will I do?<p>I will suck it up and just stick to one solution, even if it's not great. I'm really not that interested in custom Frontend work, so I want to use the best ready-made solution at hand, in my case currently <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a>, as everybody should just drop their established tool and replace it with its <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/>Rust</a> alternative. Now. Right now! Do it! Just do it!<p>My agreement with <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a> is using it as its supposed to be used and adding the missing features I like to have, if they do not take too much time and effort. I just want blogging that works fine for me, is readable by everybody and not only me, yet offers some features I personally want to have.<p>This resulted in me using <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a>, currently with the base theme of <a href=https://github.com/micahkepe/radion>Radion</a> by <a href=https://micahkepe.com/>Micah Kepe</a> - thanks man - with the addition of offering each article I post in structured formats, like <a href=https://yaml.org/>YAML</a> and <a href=https://toml.io/en/>TOML</a>.<p>Advanced article history and further metadata is naturally hosted on the <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site>Github Pages</a> associated <a href=https://github.com/Akkitto/pub>Github repository, this blog is hosted on</a>.<h2 id=where-does-blogging-lead-me><a aria-label="Anchor link for: where-does-blogging-lead-me" class=zola-anchor href=#where-does-blogging-lead-me>Where does blogging lead me?</a></h2><p>A goal without a definition of done & deadline is not a project, it's a dream.<br> Let's turn all the dreams into projects!<p>After blogging for quite some while, I want to be able to say "I have an article about that", whenever someone asks me an opinion about anything, just like <a href=http://xahlee.info/>Xah Lee</a> always does.<p>This is my ultimate goal when blogging. Aside from sharing information and inspiring people to do something interesting, rather than gambling away money by "playing" another Gacha (as in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry8enX1fBnY&t=4s">got'cha bitch</a> as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnNYgjQa7yc">Asmongold already pointed out</a>) FIFA game.</article><script async crossorigin data-category=Pub data-category-id=DIC_kwDOPhUI4s4CuZLv data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=top data-lang=en data-mapping=title data-reactions-enabled=1 data-repo=Akkitto/pub-giscus data-repo-id=R_kgDOPhUI4g data-strict=1 data-theme=dark_high_contrast src=https://giscus.app/client.js></script><footer><hr><p>Published by Daniel in <a href=https://pub.brani.dev/categories/meta/>meta</a> and tagged <a href=https://pub.brani.dev/tags/blog/>blog</a></footer></article></main>
